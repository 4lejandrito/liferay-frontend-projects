The liferay-bundle [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator is a tool to generate projects based on a toolchain where [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [liferay-npm-bundler](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-build-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-npm-bundler#liferay-npm-bundler) are used to manage project configuration and build.

There's an analogous tool based on Java, named [blade](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-cli) but projects generated with such tool need that the developer has a JDK installed to build and deploy. This is not optimum for frontend-only developers so the liferay-bundle generator covers that niche.

However there's a prerequisite to be able to deploy projects generated by this tool: you need to activate the _Liferay Frontend JS Portlet_ module in your Liferay's instance. To do that, just head up to the _App Manager_ in the _Control Panel_, search for `com.liferay.frontend.js.portlet.extender` and make sure it is active.
