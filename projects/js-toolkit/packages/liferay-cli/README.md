# @liferay/cli

This project hosts the Liferay JS Toolkit CLI Tool.

Inspired by other frameworks, like React, Angular, or Vue.js, the Liferay JS
Toolkit provides a CLI tool to invoke all implemented features, like project
generation, build, deployment, etc.

Find its documentation in the
[@liferay/cli manual](../../docs/manuals/liferay-cli.md).
