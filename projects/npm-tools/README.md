# liferay-npm-tools

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS >= [v10.15.1](http://nodejs.org/dist/v10.15.1/), if you don't have it yet.

    (At the time of writing, v10.15.1 is the version used by [liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal), and code in this project is written using "modern JS" syntax and features â€” without transpilation and executed directly.)

2. Run yarn to install local dependencies and link packages together:

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```
