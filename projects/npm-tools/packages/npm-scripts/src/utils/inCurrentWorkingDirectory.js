/**
 * Runs the `callback()` in the context of the "current" working directory,

 * invoked.
 *
 * This seems to be an undocumented feature, but `yarn run liferay-npm-scripts`
 * will walk up the directory tree looking for a `package.json` file and change
 * to that directory before invoking us, but it will helpfully set the
 * `INIT_CWD` environment variable so that we can tell where we came from:

 *      https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/922875214173757440
 *
 * This means that you can run a command like `yarn run format` in an OSGi
 * project that doesn't have a `package.json` (but may still have JS inside JSP
 * files) and have it execute scoped to that project. This is much quicker than
 * running `format` from the top, which would examine every eligible file in the
 * entire repo.
