# liferay-js-publish

> A script for publishing an NPM package via `yarn version`.

Simplifying assumptions:

-   You are working in a repository that uses Yarn
-   You develop on the "master" branch and update "stable" whenever you do a release
-   You publish using `yarn version`
-   You are millennial (or pretend to be) and expect your tools to use emoji ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

Either:

-   Install globally: `yarn global add liferay-js-publish`; or:
-   Add to a project: `yarn add --dev liferay-js-publish`; or:
-   Use the latest without installing: `npx liferay-js-publish`.

Ensure you have a ".yarnrc" file in your package root declaring the desired commit message and tag format. For example, in a monorepo, you probably want to include the package name:

```
version-tag-prefix "liferay-fancy-package/v"
version-git-message "chore: prepape liferay-fancy-package/v%s"
```

In a single-package repo, something like this might be more appropriate:

```
version-tag-prefix "v"
version-git-message "chore: prepape v%s release"
```

## Usage

### 1. Add liferay-js-publish from a "postversion" script in your "package.json".

Assuming you have a "ci" script that runs tests, you should call that in your "preversion" script as well:

```
{
    "scripts": {
      "ci": "yarn lint && yarn format:check && yarn test",
      "preversion": "yarn ci"
      "postversion": "npx liferay-js-publish"
    }
}
```

### 2. Prepare and release a new version with `yarn version`

```
# Either:
yarn version --patch # or --minor, or --major

# Or:
yarn version --new-version x.y.z
```

## Origins

This was [originally](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-tools/commit/ce2db371cce6fb2fbfbe7795dfe8807cd682e959#diff-d5ba1d0718faa51781762ae13a1c1a4a) just a `publish.js` script in the root of [the liferay-npm-tools repository](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-tools).

Similar to what we did with [liferay-changelog-generator](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-tools/tree/master/packages/liferay-changelog-generator), we extracted it into an NPM package so that it could be used from other projects, such as [eslint-config-liferay](https://github.com/liferay/eslint-config-liferay). The intention for it is to be a very small script with (almost) no dependencies.

## Example projects using liferay-js-publish

-   [eslint-config-liferay](https://github.com/liferay/eslint-config-liferay)
-   [liferay-npm-tools](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-npm-tools)
